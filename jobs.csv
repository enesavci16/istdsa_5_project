0,Information Security Analyst,8.5,47100,1.2,103590,"Information security analysts are responsible for protecting information in an organization’s computer systems from data breaches and cyberattacks. Since lots of sensitive data is stored electronically these days, including bank account numbers and passwords, these professionals are crucial.Information security analysts may install and maintain firewalls or data encryption software, develop security standards and best practices to protect sensitive information, identify risks and vulnerabilities in an organization’s network systems, and investigate if a data breach occurs.“The opportunities are vast right now in the profession,” says Casey Cegielski, a professor at Auburn University who specializes in information security, and a partner at a cybersecurity consulting firm. “Every organization needs security people who have a strong industry understanding and are willing to learn technical skills and continue to grow.”The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 33.3 percent employment growth for information security analysts between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 47,100 jobs should open up."
1,Nurse Practitioner,8.4,114900,1.2,111680,"Nurse practitioners are registered nurses with additional education. Extra schooling allows these professionals to take patient histories, perform physical exams, order labs, analyze lab results, prescribe medicines, authorize treatments and educate patients and families on continued care. Nurse practitioners, also known as advanced practice registered nurses, specialize by patient population, training to work in areas like women's health or pediatrics. They may also work in research or academia.Their job sounds similar to a physician's role, right? So, what's the difference? The main contrast is the amount of formal education required. Physicians have more training, and their breadth of knowledge and their salaries are usually commensurate with their additional work. However, increasingly – and somewhat controversially – nurse practitioners are providing primary care to patients. Many nurse practitioners first worked as registered nurses, where their treatment of patients extended to holistic and wellness care; they bring that background to the diagnosis, treatment and management of medical issues.Nurse practitioners are handsomely paid for their work, with the top 50% taking home six-figure salaries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 52.2 percent employment growth for nurse practitioners between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 114,900 jobs should open up."
2,Physician Assistant,8.3,40100,1.4,115390,"Physician assistants, also known as physician associates, are ubiquitous in the medical world. They use their medical expertise to examine, diagnose and treat patients, working closely with other health care professionals as a team to provide patient care.Jennifer M. Orozco, president and chair of the American Academy of Physician Associates board for the July 2021 to June 2022 term and director of advanced practice providers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, says physician assistants “help fill in a lot of access gaps across the country.”“They practice medicine in every health care setting, from hospitals to emergency rooms to private practice to operating suites,” Orozco says. “They take care of a patient in every specialty, from primary care to pediatrics all the way through geriatrics and palliative care.”While specific duties depend on factors including setting, specialty and state laws, physician assistants can take medical histories, assist in surgeries, conduct physical exams, prescribe medication, perform clinical research and more, according to the AAPA.“The team-based model is the hallmark of our profession,” Orozco says. “It’s who we are and really it’s about us keeping that commitment to our patients because we know that our patients’ needs are first. And patients have better outcomes when they have a team-based approach to care.”The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 31.0 percent employment growth for physician assistants between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 40,100 jobs should open up."
3,Medical and Health Services Manager,8.1,139600,2.2,104280,"Medical and health services managers are the planners, directors and coordinators who work behind the scenes to keep hospitals, nursing homes, group practices and other health care facilities running efficiently. In short, they are super-organized professionals.Medical and health services managers are usually extremely detail-oriented people with good analytical skills. Because much of their time is spent working with doctors, health insurance representatives and other administrators, they should also have good interpersonal and communication skills. Problem-solving is another part of the job. Technical skills are also a must because these professionals must keep up-to-date with software and electronic health records.A high demand for more medical and health services managers is driven by the large baby boomer population needing more health care in hospitals, group practices and nursing homes as they age. It’s also driven by the uptick in group practices and the need for managers and administrators to helm these facilities. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 32.5 percent employment growth for medical and health services managers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 139,600 jobs should open up."
4,Software Developer,8.0,409500,3,110140,"Software developers invent the technologies we sometimes take for granted. For instance, that app that rings, sings or buzzes you out of a deep sleep every morning? A software developer helped design that. And when you roll into the office and turn on your computer, clicking and scrolling through social media, music and your personal calendar – software developers had a big hand in shaping those, too. You might spend your lunch shopping, and before you make that big purchase, you check your bank account balance using your phone. Later, you're cooking a new recipe from that great app your friend told you about. As you look over the course of your day, you come to see that software developers are the masterminds behind the technologies you now can't imagine living without.The best software developers are creative and have the technical expertise to carry out innovative ideas. You might expect software developers to sit at their desks designing programs all day – and they do, but their job involves many more responsibilities. They could spend their days working on a client project from scratch and writing new code. But they could also be tasked with maintaining or improving the code for programs that are already up and running. Software developers also check for bugs in software. And although the job does involve extreme concentration and chunks of uninterrupted time, software developers have to collaborate with others, including fellow developers, managers or clients. Developers are often natural problem solvers who possess strong analytical skills and the ability to think outside the box.Software developers are employed in a range of industries, including computer systems design, manufacturing and finance. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 22.2 percent employment growth for software developers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 409,500 jobs should open up."
5,Data Scientist,7.9,19800,2,98230,"Data scientists use technology to glean insights from large amounts of data they collect. It’s a field that requires statistics, quantitative reasoning and computer programming skills. On top of all that, you need to be a good communicator so you can report your research findings and explain how they address a larger question you’re trying to answer. “A data scientist really is a scientist at heart,” says Scott Beliveau, chief of the enterprise advanced analytics branch within the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Office of the Chief Technology Officer. “But rather than using chemicals or other things, a data scientist uses data – numbers, zeros, sometimes it’s textual information – to try and solve and answer problems.” While data science is still a new career field, employers are increasingly recognizing the value of professionals with this expertise. Today, you’ll find data scientists working at a range of organizations, including tech startups, government agencies, large companies and research institutions. Chris Holdgraf, director of the nonprofit International Interactive Computing Collaboration, which helps researchers and educators run data science infrastructure in the cloud, started learning about data science as a graduate student at University of California, Berkeley. With the help of data whizzes at the university, he taught himself coding, analytics and other skills that he thought would help him conduct neuroscience research.“By the end of my Ph.D., I had inadvertently built a pretty nice set of (data science) skills,” he says. While serving as a fellow at the university’s Berkeley Institute for Data Science, Holdgraf collected data from electrodes placed directly onto the surface of patients’ brains to learn more about how they hear. Feeding the data into computer programs he created, Holdgraf ran experiments, made observations and drew conclusions about the brain’s response to different types of sounds. Then, he wrote papers about the results.“Being a data scientist gives me the flexibility to work with people with many different kinds of backgrounds and to work on problems that are meaningful to lots of different communities, which I really enjoy,” he says. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 31.4 percent employment growth for data scientists between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 19,800 jobs should open up."
6,Financial Manager,7.6,118200,2.9,134180,"Financial managers have the responsibility of overseeing the finances of major companies, agencies and everything in between. Along with their teams, they coordinate accounting and produce financial reports, cash-flow statements and profit projections. To comply with various laws and regulations, they must pay attention to detail. Aside from working with numbers, financial managers must also help other members of their organization understand their complex reports, which requires significant communication skills. Financial managers face a competitive job market. Those who can also handle international finance and the increasingly complicated world of financial instruments and securities, including derivatives, will be the most marketable.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 17.3 percent employment growth for financial managers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 118,200 jobs should open up."
7,Statistician,7.6,14900,2,92270,"Statisticians practice the science of using data to make decisions. They decide what data they need and how to collect it, design experiments, analyze and interpret data, and report conclusions. And unlike most professions, statistics can be applied to a vast number of fields or issues, like the environment, public safety, health care and sports. As the famous mathematician and statistician John Tukey once told a colleague, ""The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard.""Devan Mehrotra, executive director of the biostatistics department at Merck Research Laboratories, says, ""I absolutely fell in love with statistics. Any real-world problem almost always is going to require some data to be analyzed and interpreted, generating value-added solutions by using statistics.""Going forward, Mehrotra sees statisticians working closely with collaborators from the biomedical, computer, environmental, genetics and social sciences as well as contributing to quantitative solutions involving human rights and counterterrorism. ""Statistics is one of oldest professions in the world; it dates back to the 1700s. There's a tremendous history ... and now more exciting opportunities. It has never been a better time to be a statistician,"" Mehrotra says.While some may confuse statisticians with the growing data scientist profession, the fields have some key differences. Statistics is just one component of data science. Data scientists should have a basic working knowledge of statistics. However, data scientists tend to focus more on software programming and machine learning than statisticians do. Data scientists may serve as the lead software engineering coordinator at companies with smaller data science teams. Data scientists should possess the skills to log data, which is not necessarily expected of statisticians.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 35.4 percent employment growth for statisticians between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 14,900 jobs should open up."
8,Lawyer,7.6,71500,1.1,126930,"A lawyer advises and represents individuals or organizations in legal matters. Depending on their specialty and what type of law they practice, a lawyer may represent a client in civil or criminal court, or help a client write a will.“There’s a reason why lawyers are usually called counsel; that’s essentially what our job is, to counsel,” says Juan Santamaria, a Houston-based staff attorney at the nonprofit Lone Star Legal Aid, who specializes in landlord-tenant cases. “We don’t just go to court to fight and argue. Our entire job is to complete a task for our client and to give our best counsel to that client to complete that task.”Lawyers may work for nonprofit organizations or for federal, state or local governments, but the majority work in private or corporate legal offices, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Some lawyers work as district attorneys, prosecuting criminal cases within a jurisdiction, while others work as public defenders, representing individuals who are accused of crimes and can’t afford to hire an attorney. Some lawyers work as legal advisers to universities, municipalities or corporations. Environmental lawyers may work with waste disposal companies to make sure they comply with relevant laws related to the environment, family lawyers may advise clients during child custody or adoption proceedings, and securities lawyers may advise companies that are interested in listing in the stock exchange through an initial public offering.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 8.9 percent employment growth for lawyers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 71,500 jobs should open up."
9,Speech-Language Pathologist,7.4,45400,2.5,80480,"Speech-language pathologists evaluate, diagnose and treat people with speech, language or swallowing difficulties. They work with many types of patients, including stroke victims who are relearning to speak, babies who have trouble swallowing, people who speak with a stutter and children with language delays. “Our field is so broad,” says Karen George, a speech-language pathologist and owner of Chicago Speech Therapy. “We’re trained to work with babies through adults – the entire life span.”Sometimes called speech therapists, SLPs work in a variety of settings, such as rehabilitation centers and nursing homes. George started her career in a hospital before moving to her own private practice, while Theresa Rodgers, former president of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, spent her career in a public school setting. “Communication is such an essential skill in life, but certainly in a school environment,” Rodgers says. “It was so rewarding to be able to work on curriculum-based activities and see children become more successful in the classroom.”Indeed, George says that helping someone communicate can boost their overall standard of living. “Communication is just such a key part of everyday life.” The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 28.7 percent employment growth for speech-language pathologists between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 45,400 jobs should open up."
10,Physician,7.4,18700,0.7,208000,"Physicians – also known as primary care doctors – are a patient’s first stop when flu symptoms arise, an irregular mole or lump appears, a headache won’t subside, or any number of other health questions come up. Physicians also see their patients when they’re healthy for annual check-ups, where they complete an exam and order tests to help catch health problems early on – or even prevent them before they start. Physicians are trained to take a patient’s medical history and order tests to identify any irregularities. Based on the exams and test results, physicians might prescribe medication or a treatment plan. They also answer questions patients have related to their health, and they offer advice for healthy living. Dr. Robert McLean, a rheumatologist and regional medical director with Northeast Medical Group, which is affiliated with the Yale New Haven Health system in Connecticut, says the profession is incredibly gratifying. “You’ll look back and realize you’ve seen your patients over 20 years through the good and the bad, and you realize how much you mean to them and how much they mean to you,” he says. “It just doesn’t get better than that. The patient-physician relationship is absolutely sacrosanct.”  The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 4.5 percent employment growth for physicians between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 18,700 jobs should open up."
11,Registered Nurse,7.4,276800,2.4,75330,"Registered nurses are responsible for monitoring a patient's condition, performing medical procedures and administering medicine. They also chart a patient's progress. These professionals work with a range of patients, from those who are healthy (and are proactively trying to stay that way), to those who are pregnant and bringing new life, to those who are nearing the end of life and hoping for a peaceful death. ""Nurses have a very holistic view of health and well-being, and I really appreciated that perspective,"" Erin Whitehouse, an RN and a Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, writes in an email. ""[They] look at an entire person and their situation, not just what medical concern they have.""It's a philosophy that Florence Nightingale, the pioneer of modern nursing who lived more than a century ago, practiced, and her legacy lives on in hospitals, clinics and schools. Nightingale's concern for patients stretched beyond administering medication to caring for the whole person – physically as well as emotionally, intellectually and spiritually. And she backed up her nursing philosophies with research. Today, nursing research is just one of the exciting changes in the field, says Kathy McCauley, associate dean of academic programs at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Nursing. Increasingly, evidence-based science is confirming the contributions nurses make to patient care.Many nurses specialize and work with patients who have a certain health condition, like cancer or diabetes. They can also specialize by body part. For instance, there are dermatology nurses and cardiovascular nurses, among others. RNs can also specialize by people group (like newborn babies) or by environment (like a school or hospital emergency room). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 9.0 percent employment growth for registered nurses between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 276,800 jobs should open up."
12,IT Manager,7.3,52700,2.9,151150,"Computer and information systems managers, or information technology managers, are the guides who help organizations navigate the always-changing labyrinth that is modern technology. These all-important employees deliver short- and long-term visions for the company's technology needs and goals. Even though most IT managers have the technical chops to execute the various jobs of the workers they supervise, they are more likely to be caught in a meeting room than a server room. Coordinating technology-related matters with top executives, planning upgrades of existing software or hardware and negotiating with vendors for the service of current products or the purchase of new ones are all common tasks IT managers encounter. IT managers also install and upgrade an organization's computer system and protect the office network from hackers and malware. When the job is done well, many employees won't even notice the work involved. If you haven't had an email interruption or server meltdown in the past few months, you probably have an IT manager to thank.While the highest-profile jobs are in computer systems design, almost all organizations need IT managers, especially financial and insurance companies, manufacturing firms and federal, state and local governments. The rapidly growing health care industry is also expected to greatly increase its IT use, resulting in newly created positions. The chief drivers of this growth will be organizations upgrading their information technology systems to newer, faster networks and striving to avoid cyberthreats. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 10.9 percent employment growth for it managers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 52,700 jobs should open up."

14,Operations Research Analyst,7.2,25600,1.8,86200,"Operations research analysts are high-level problem-solvers who use advanced techniques, such as optimization, data mining, statistical analysis and mathematical modeling, to develop solutions that help businesses and organizations operate more efficiently and cost-effectively. For example, UPS uses operations research to chart the flow of packages, provide real-time route guidance to drivers and help plan and manage distribution. In the health care field, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York used operations research to design a radiation treatment plan for prostate patients using sophisticated modeling and computation techniques. Anne Robinson, chief strategy officer for supply chain management software company Kinaxis and past president of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences, says, in a nutshell, operations research analysts provide the insights for businesses to make decisions at the next level. ""This is really decision guidance. Companies are trying to get value out of big data and analytics platforms investments, and they need the right talent to take it from raw data to an intelligent asset for business,"" says Robinson, whose focus includes developing models to ensure Verizon stores have enough inventory to meet demand.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 24.6 percent employment growth for operations research analysts between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 25,600 jobs should open up."
15,Respiratory Therapist,7.2,31100,1.4,62810,"Respiratory therapists care for patients with heart and lung problems. They often treat people who have asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, cystic fibrosis or sleep apnea; and they also have the skills to respond to some emergency situations, like those experiencing a heart attack or suffering a stroke. ""Respiratory therapists are the go-to lung experts, and the only medical professionals to receive college and clinical education in the art and science of mechanical ventilation and advanced respiratory therapies,"" says Daniel Garrett, executive director of the American Association for Respiratory Care. ""Respiratory therapists are vital to the interdisciplinary team that cares for patients struggling to breathe. They have the opportunity to specialize or treat a broad range of conditions and patients. From the very first breaths of a newborn to emergency transport to helping older patients manage their pulmonary disease, respiratory therapists are there to improve and save lives. It's a challenging and rewarding profession."" Even after completing their educational requirements, respiratory therapists work to stay steps ahead of evolving health care practices and treat the growing number of Americans struggling with heart and lung problems. They perform diagnostic tests for lung capacity, administer breathing treatments, record patient progress and consult with physicians and surgeons.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that there are 16 million adults in the U.S. living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a condition that limits air flow and causes breathing trouble.  Given future health care needs, this field has promising job prospects.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 23.0 percent employment growth for respiratory therapists between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 31,100 jobs should open up."
16,Management Analyst,7.1,124400,4.8,87660,"Management analysts – also known as management consultants – are typically hired to find ways to improve an organization's efficiency and increase profits. Management consultants collect and analyze data about how a company works and then recommend changes that will decrease costs or boost revenue. Consultants often present their suggestions as a written report and oral presentation, which can help companies implement their recommendations.""We want to help make the client better at what they do,"" says Mel Wolfgang, managing director and senior partner in charge of consulting team talent functions in North America at The Boston Consulting Group.

17,Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon,6.9,400,0.7,208000,"Oral and maxillofacial surgeons perform surgeries on the face, mouth and jaw. These professionals are dentists with at least four years of additional surgery training, so they can do everything from treating facial traumas to fixing cleft lips. They can diagnose and treat patients with head, neck and oral cancer. They can even administer anesthesia and perform cosmetic surgeries, such as face-lifts. But even though their specialty is specific, the technology used to treat and operate on the face, mouth and jaw is constantly evolving. ""You have to have a commitment to lifelong learning,"" says Louis Rafetto, former president of the American Association of Maxillofacial Surgeons, chairman of the oral and maxillofacial residency program at Christiana Care Health Systems and a private practitioner in Wilmington, Delaware. In general, Rafetto says, ""the surgeries will stay the same, but the way we do them will change."" The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 7.7 percent employment growth for oral and maxillofacial surgeons between 2020 and 2030.

18,Nurse Anesthetist,6.9,5600,N/A,183580,"Nurse anesthetists can use a number of intravenous drugs and inhaled gasses to administer general or regional anesthesia, so surgeons and other physicians can complete procedures with little to no discomfort to the patient. Modern anesthesia has come a long way from the chloroform administered by the first nurse anesthetists in the Civil War. ""Anesthesia is safer today than it's ever been,"" says Frank Gerbasi, a certified registered nurse anesthetist and executive director of the Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs.You might wonder what the difference is between a nurse anesthetist and an anesthesiologist. One way of answering is the education. Nurse anesthetists are registered nurses who specialize in anesthesiology with at least one year of critical care experience and a master's degree, which usually take two years to complete. Anesthesiologists are physicians, and their education track includes four years of medical school and years of experience that include an internship, residency, and sometimes an additional residency. ""Both anesthesia specialists use the same techniques and procedures to safely deliver the same types of anesthetic drugs for every type of procedure that requires the patient to receive anesthesia,"" Gerbasi says. Gerbasi also describes nurse anesthetists as cost-effective providers because they offer their patients a high quality of health care at a reasonable price. Several factors, including health care reform and the aging baby boom population, are precipitating the demand for more health care providers.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 12.6 percent employment growth for nurse anesthetists between 2020 and 2030.

Logisticians make sure the necessary equipment, supplies and skilled technicians arrive quickly and with the right tools at their side. Their skills lie in making these behind-the-the scenes undertakings appear effortless, so companies and governments can continue running smoothly. But logisticians don't just deal in disaster response. They also focus on supply chains, identifying areas for improvement and developing strategies to minimize costs and maximize efficiency. Logisticians populate almost every field, from retail to finance to government.

Beyond babies, sonograms are used to help diagnose medical conditions by creating images of body organs and tissues. These professionals include musculoskeletal sonographers, who specialize in creating images of muscles, ligaments, tendons and joints; abdominal sonographers, who capture images of the abdominal cavity as well as nearby organs like the kidney, liver and pancreas; and breast sonographers, who capture images of breast tissue that could confirm the presence of cysts and tumors. Skilled diagnostic medical sonographers play a vital role in ensuring a proper diagnosis. The job uses both social and technical elements, since sonographers must position a patient just right so that a properly calibrated machine can produce the best possible image. The job also requires social savvy, since the sonographer can be the first person nervous patients turn to for information about their condition.With advances in imaging technology, many medical facilities use it in place of costly, invasive procedures. More procedures will be conducted outside of hospitals, as a result. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 19.0 percent employment growth for diagnostic medical sonographers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 14,400 jobs should open up."
22,Veterinarian,6.9,14500,0.8,99250,"Veterinarians examine, diagnose and treat animals. They can also perform surgeries, care for wounds, vaccinate against diseases and prescribe medications. In worst-case scenarios, vets are also qualified to euthanize sick or dying animals. Some of the biggest changes Dr. Lorin D. Warnick, dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University, has seen over the course of his career are people's attitudes toward their pets. ""Many more people view animals as family members,"" he says. And that means their expectation for the quality of care is much higher now as well.Technology in the field has also evolved, Warnick says. Vets are now using everything from advanced surgical technologies to fight cancer to MRIs to care for animals. Genomics are also being used to test for specific genetic traits. But a veterinarian's work doesn't stop with dogs and cats. Some vets specialize in caring for farm animals, and some even protect the safety of our food supply by inspecting livestock. Others promote public health by fighting animal-borne diseases and help foster healthier relationships between people and their animal companions.

Meeks has worked in marketing for more than two decades, including a few years as a marketing manager.The exact job duties can differ according to the industry that you’re employed in – for example, whether the role is with a private company, a tourism bureau or a higher education institution – but a marketing manager generally is responsible for crafting plans that create interest for a product or service. For instance, in higher education, a marketing manager may create a plan to help the university meet its enrollment goals.In addition to creating and executing marketing plans, duties may include hiring and overseeing a marketing team, meeting with clients or stakeholders, doing market research, and evaluating the success of a campaign after its launch.“When I worked in that role at the University of Arizona, I was responsible for understanding what the goals were overall, where the students needed to come from, and how many students needed to be there,” Meeks says. “And then I needed to come up with campaigns that would attract those students.” The angle or scope of a marketing campaign could differ depending on whether it was targeted at local residents or designed to recruit students from other states.Marketing managers should have a broad understanding of the various aspects involved in a marketing campaign. And they must work well with other stakeholders, including art directors, financial staff members and heads of other departments.“It’s an amazing opportunity to see a wide swath of an organization because marketing hits so many areas,” Meeks says. “So you have that kind of catbird seat to see across an amazing organization and how it works. And you learn so much from all those different entities, where you can drive the product or service.”The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 10.0 percent employment growth for marketing managers between 2020 and 2030.

There is clearly a public service element to the job that you could reasonably call heroic, but there's also a cost to your personal life. Officers work long hours and suffer high rates of job-related injury. Still, for those with the right character, the protect-and-serve profession can be very rewarding.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 7.2 percent employment growth for patrol officers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 48,600 jobs should open up."
25,Business Operations Manager,6.8,226300,5.7,103650,"Business operations managers are the go-to people in a business. They help various departments within a company coordinate to meet the end goal. Every business needs them, large or small, regardless of industry. Their job includes hiring people, negotiating contracts, addressing budget matters, understanding general business operations and guiding work teams for projects. They also make strategic decisions about what customers are likely to buy and create company policies that help the staff operate efficiently. Duties vary widely and depend on the company’s needs. ""Operations really is the heart of most companies, because the operations department actually gets the job that the company needs to get done, done,"" says Eric Schaudt, manager of operations programs, material planning and analysis at Northrop Grumman, a global security company.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 9.4 percent employment growth for business operations managers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 226,300 jobs should open up."
26,Computer Systems Analyst,6.8,42800,2.6,93730,"Computer systems analysts leverage both their knowledge of information technology and business to design better computer systems and processes for their clients. And although these professionals have many responsibilities, their first task is to understand their client's business, whether it's an organization in Silicon Valley or a firm on Wall Street. And they'll specifically want to learn how the organization uses technology. Analysts will then research the best technologies to help the organization's overall computer system – the hardware, the software and the networks – run more efficiently and effectively. But their job doesn't stop at research. These professionals also employ their business acumen to prepare a cost and benefits analysis for the upgrades. And if management approves the upgrades, computer systems analysts will oversee the installation of the new systems. They also test the systems and train their organization in them. And when the inevitable hiccups arise, computer systems analysts are the ones who troubleshoot the problems. You'll find far more extroverts in this field than in other IT jobs, since the job duties include near-constant collaboration with others. Randy Weinberg, teaching faculty emeritus of the information systems program at Carnegie Mellon University, worked in technology since the mainframe days, when people who worked with enormous computers wore special lab coats. The advances in the field have been constant. ""It never gets less exciting,"" he says. ""It's a constant challenge to keep up with all of the changes."" From compliance and privacy issues to the increasing reliance on mobile technologies, the industry is persistently changing. Many analysts work for computer systems design firms, but they're also employed by a host of industries that range from science to health care to banking and finance. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 7.0 percent employment growth for computer systems analysts between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 42,800 jobs should open up."
27,Physical Therapist,6.8,49100,6.7,91010,"Many doctors refer patients with physical issues from athletic injuries to neurological traumas to physical therapists. These professionals come to the rescue after a stress fracture sidelines a runner, when an awkward slide into home base benches a softball player or after a stroke keeps a person bedridden. First, physical therapists evaluate a patient and examine his or her medical records. Then, they plan and execute rehabilitative programs designed to improve the patient's mobility, increase his or her strength and relieve or at least lessen his or her pain. Treatment plans often include different exercises and stretches, as well as hands-on therapies and machines that assist with improving muscle strength, range of motion and motor function. The job also includes educating the patient – or members of the patient's support system – on the recovery process. Physical therapists will also consult with other health care professionals, including physicians, occupational therapists and clinical social workers, to offer a patient the best, most holistic care possible.Eric Robertson, the director of Kaiser Permanente Northern California Graduate Physical Therapy Education, says he first learned about the profession at age 15, when he was involved in a motocross accident. He required physical therapy, and over the next 10 months of rehab, he got to know his therapist really well, and the field appealed to him. ""Physical therapy is a real safe, happy approach,"" he says. ""It offers a meaningful and positive alternative to pharmaceuticals or surgery.""The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 20.5 percent employment growth for physical therapists between 2020 and 2030.

28,Construction Manager,6.7,51400,4.1,97180,"Construction managers obtain work permits, hire contractors, troubleshoot emergencies, schedule walkthroughs and keep clients informed on work timetables and progress. Construction management is ideal for someone who has a general interest in building and design. Architecture might seem like too much drawing. Civil engineering could seem like too much science. Cost estimating is too much math. Carpentry might be too much manual labor. Working as a construction manager affords the chance to learn a construction project from soup to nuts – from the planning stage with architects and engineers, to the budgeting stage with cost estimators, to the production stage with laborers.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 11.5 percent employment growth for construction managers between 2020 and 2030.

29,Occupational Therapy Assistant,6.7,15600,N/A,62940,"Occupational therapy assistants help people get back into the routine of living. The everyday tasks that most of us take for granted – getting dressed or brushing our teeth, for instance – are an occupational therapy assistant's crowning achievements. But what's the difference between an occupational therapist and an occupational therapy assistant? Michele Luther-Krug, an occupational therapy assistant working for Piedmont Healthcare in Atlanta, gives a good explanation: ""An OTA provides treatment according to goals written by the OT in the plan of care."" So, it's a collaborative effort, with the occupational therapist taking the lead.Patients require occupational therapy for a number of reasons. A fluke accident or a stroke or lifelong conditions like cerebral palsy will bring patients to an occupational therapy office. And OTAs will help these patients to live independent – or as independent as possible – lives by teaching them ways to perform the daily tasks and routines of life. An OTA, for instance, will help construct a plan so that a wheelchair-bound child can navigate the school hallways, locker room and cafeteria on his or her own. An OTA will also create plans for those with spinal cord injuries, and they'll explain to these patients how to live with their new paralysis. The goals for each patient will vary depending on his or her condition.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 36.1 percent employment growth for occupational therapy assistants between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 15,600 jobs should open up."
30,Occupational Therapist,6.7,23000,3.5,86280,"Occupational therapists work with patients to build or restore their abilities to perform the daily tasks of life. Occupational therapy can look very different depending on what sorts of issues the patient is dealing with, whether mental, physical, emotional or developmental. After a thorough assessment of a patient, the OT will then create a plan and work toward helping that patient meet certain goals, which may range from eating and bathing to operating a computer and maintaining a budget. Their work also includes keeping meticulous records on the patient's progress. Occupational therapists work in a number of diverse environments, such as hospitals, rehabilitation centers, schools, small medical offices and clients' homes. They also work in policy and administration, as well as research and academia.When Samia Rafeedie was an undergrad at The Ohio State University, she sought out the help of an academic adviser. She knew she wanted to work in health care, but she just didn't know ""where"" in health care. Her adviser suggested occupational therapy. Rafeedie remembers thinking, ""I don't want to help people find jobs."" But she followed up her adviser's recommendation with a visit to an open house in the School of Allied Medicine, where health care professionals from different fields described their work. She'll never forget what an occupational therapist said there. ""Physical therapy teaches people how to walk, and occupational therapy teaches them how to dance.""Rafeedie, now an associate professor of clinical occupational therapy and director of the professional program at the University of Southern California Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, was sold on the profession. ""We help people do the every day 'occupations' of life, regardless of age, ability or disability,"" she writes in an email. The field has seen some vast changes in the last couple of decades. One of the most exciting, writes Rafeedie, is the inception of occupational science. This is ""the development of the science that validates what we do as occupational therapists, as it studies how meaningful activities – occupations – impact health, wellness, and well-being."" There's also been an increased drive for further research and clinical outcomes, as well as a push for more preventive and proactive paradigms as opposed to just reactionary rehabilitative paradigms.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 17.5 percent employment growth for occupational therapists between 2020 and 2030.

But the rest of the time is a lot of being in the code.”Web developers must possess good research skills as they try to understand clients’ needs and create desired products. They must have good project management and logical reasoning skills and should communicate effectively with clients and teammates.The scope of a web developer’s job can depend on their specialty and what they’re most experienced in. Back-end developers are responsible for writing the code that stores and processes data on a site. Front-end developers focus more on the user interface and need an eye for design.

Other fashion designers might send off their patterns to third parties to make for them.Fashion designers may showcase their designs in fashion or design shows. They also oversee production of the pieces and the marketing to consumers. “As you know, in fashion, one day you’re in. And the next day you’re out,” says Heidi Klum, model and former host of the reality TV show “Project Runway.” Utkarsh Shukla, a patternmaker with New York design company Peter Do, agrees. It’s true that the industry is volatile, but there’s nothing like it either, he says. Shukla, who grew up in India, was always drawn to art. He noticed that when he watched films, he would pay attention to the clothes and how they were made. “I also had the luxury of growing up with amazing women in my life and I would see how they would dress up,” he says. “There was always this idea of confidence that came from clothing, and that was very powerful to me.”Now he works at Peter Do, where he makes patterns for fashionable-yet-functional pieces for women who appreciate the idea of luxury and high quality craftsmanship. “It’s amazing,” he says.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 0.5 percent employment growth for fashion designers between 2020 and 2030.

33,Substance Abuse and Behavioral Disorder Counselor,6.6,75100,4,47660,"Substance abuse and behavioral disorder counselors provide treatment and support for those struggling with an addiction to drugs or alcohol, or for those burdened by an eating disorder or a behavioral problem. These mental health professionals can be a guiding force for patients integrating back into areas of their lives where their behavior has left a destructive trail, including work and personal relationships. Part of that process involves consulting with the families of patients about the treatment options best suited for their loved ones. But substance abuse and behavioral disorder counselors don't only offer their expertise to patients. Counselors often run outreach programs to warn others about the dangers of addiction and encourage a healthy lifestyle. Hearing about the devastating effects addiction has had on a person's life can be an emotional experience every day, so those who wish to enter this field should have a temperament that mixes empathy with patience.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 22.9 percent employment growth for substance abuse and behavioral disorder counselors between 2020 and 2030.

You'll be asked to create print and web-based communications materials – which may include story pitches, press releases, Q&A interviews, presentations, video scripts and speeches – that are consistent with your client's image and message. Other responsibilities range from acting as a company spokesperson for a variety of media inquiries and speaking directly to the press on behalf of your client – sometimes deflecting negative criticism – to preparing your client for press conferences, media interviews and speeches. Social media outreach has become an integral part of a PR specialist's job in recent years.

35,Pediatrician,6.5,-500,0.7,177130,"Pediatricians are doctors concerned with the physical, emotional and social well-being of children from infancy to young adulthood. Although it is a specialty in itself, pediatrics also has multitudinous subspecialties ranging from neonatology, oncology and hematology to developmental-behavioral pediatrics and psychiatry. Those who choose to be pediatricians have to love being around children and advocating for children's issues.Steven Abrams lists many reasons pediatricians like him choose their occupation. ""We've gone to medical school and found that we like to be around kids,"" he says. ""The diseases children have are usually not self-inflicted, so you have the chance to do more preventative care."" One of Abrams' reasons particularly stood out: ""It's one of the few jobs where a doctor gets to hug his patients,"" explains the director of the Dell Pediatric Research Institute and professor of pediatrics at Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at Austin.For most kids, interaction with a primary care pediatrician starts in infancy, far before they've developed communication skills. ""We don't always have the ability, especially with babies, to ask them to describe their pain,"" Abrams says. ""We use a pain scale that's based on heart rate and movement, and also a lot of visual experience. You become an expert at looking at children to determine if they're sick."" The profession is also unique because it includes a touch of advocacy. ""There's no AARP for children,"" Abrams says. ""So often, pediatricians are the public voice. When I was in medical school I had no idea how much of the job involves advocacy and standing up for children. … You're considered the expert on children's issues, and that wasn't a part of the job that I'd naturally known."" These doctors exercise their voice on a smaller scale, too. ""Our assumption is that the parents always know best for their children,"" Abrams says. ""But there are standards of behavior we expect as well, and we have to make sure the parents are acting in their children's best interests. You spend a lot of time talking to the parents about the care you're giving their child, but you have to explain it to your patient, the child, as well."" The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects -1.8 percent employment growth for pediatricians between 2020 and 2030.

36,Optometrist,6.5,3900,N/A,118050,"Optometrists meet with patients and perform different tests to determine common eyesight issues, such as near- or farsightedness, for which they can prescribe glasses or contacts. They can also test patients for eye diseases, such as glaucoma, for which they can prescribe medicines. Optometrists can also perform vision therapy for other issues, such as eye-movement or eye-tracking problems. Sometimes optometrists run across a problem like diabetic retinopathy, which is symptomatic of a systemic problem like diabetes. Eyesight is invaluable for everyday tasks like walking through a doorway or driving a car and also for pleasures like watching a sunset, reading a book or a viewing a film. If you were to take a poll on which of the five senses are most important to people, sight would probably be high on the list. That's why an optometrist's job is so important.

With information so readily available in this era of apps, tablets and social media, data has become the new treasure organizations must protect and cherish. More than anyone else, database administrators are relied on as the guardians of this treasure, implementing security measures to ensure sensitive data doesn't fall into the hands of unruly pirates while also managing the databases that help store and organize it.  The job involves resolving complex issues, so attention to detail is an essential trait in this profession, as is a passion for problem-solving. Communication skills are also important since DBAs often work as part of a team with computer programmers and managers. Ongoing maintenance of a database requires being on call.

38,Epidemiologist/Medical Scientist,6.4,2300,2.2,74560,"Epidemiologists examine the causes of diseases to prevent them from transmitting and recurring, including investigating the triggers of an infection for a public health agency or collecting blood samples at an outpatient care center. These medical scientists might work in hospitals, laboratories or universities, or for pharmaceutical companies or health insurers.  At a hospital, ""the role is basically like a public health officer,"" says Tom Talbot, chief hospital epidemiologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.  An epidemiologist, also known as a medical scientist, conducts infection surveillance – tracking infections, reading data, assessing where problems may reside and deciding where intervention is needed. Talbot says epidemiologists have the opportunity to provide thoughtful, scientific analysis to help improve the care of patients and the safety of health care workers. When there was an outbreak of Ebola in the U.S., for example, epidemiologists had their work cut out for them.

43,Anesthesiologist,6.4,-200,0.7,208000,"Anesthesiologists are the physicians responsible for administering general or regional anesthesia, which allows surgeons and other physicians to complete invasive procedures with little to no discomfort to the patient. Anesthesiologists also closely monitor a patient's vital signs and critical life functions before, during and after a surgery – making rapid decisions on limited data when required. To say that the profession is stressful is an understatement.More than 150 years ago, ether – the first anesthetic – was hailed the ""greatest gift ever made to suffering humanity."" Today the drugs are different, but any woman who has experienced the excruciating pain of contractions followed by the amazing relief of an epidural will tell you that anesthesia remains one of the greatest gifts to humanity.Anesthesia is often portrayed as going to sleep, but J.P. Abenstein, an associate professor of anesthesiology at the Mayo Medical School, explains that general anesthesia is more akin to a powerful drug-induced coma. Anesthesiologists typically administer a combination of intravenous drugs and inhaled gasses to render a patient unconscious and pain-free. For operations on the head, chest or abdomen, anesthesiologists also have to support a patient's breathing with a breathing tube. So it's no wonder that Abenstein describes the job like this: ""An anesthesiologist keeps a patient alive during an invasive procedure that would otherwise kill them.""Anesthesiologists may also employ sedation, in which medication is administered intravenously to calm the patient. With regional anesthesia, as opposed to general, anesthesiologists inject medications near a knot of nerves to prevent pain signals from traveling to the brain – in other words, numb a certain part of the body. Patients who are given regional anesthesia are awake, although they may also be sedated intravenously, which helps them relax, feel drowsy or even sleep, depending on the level of sedation.Abenstein says the breadth of the profession has dramatically expanded in the last decade. Anesthesiologists still work in hospital operating rooms, but their expertise is also needed in other places, including invasive radiology, gastrointestinal endoscopy, electrophysiology and more.

44,Obstetrician and Gynecologist,6.4,-400,0.7,208000,"Obstetricians and gynecologists bring new life into the world and care for the spectrum of women's reproductive health. Obstetrics is the surgical field that deals in childbirth, whereas gynecology is the field of medicine concerned with women's health, especially their reproductive health. One can be a gynecologist and not an obstetrician, though one cannot be an obstetrician without being a gynecologist. OB-GYNs see patients in physicians' offices for routine ""well-woman"" exams, which could include contraceptive management and HPV screening. Mark S. DeFrancesco, former president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, writes in an email, ""You cannot imagine what it feels like to deliver a baby – to be the first person to hold another new life in your hands and help create a new family!"" They also assist patients who come to them with issues like abnormal bleeding. ""To be able to accurately diagnose and successfully treat these problems is extremely gratifying,"" DeFrancesco says. And of course, OB-GYNs also work in the labor and delivery section of hospitals, monitoring mothers and babies during labor and – when things don't go as planned – making medical decisions to protect the lives of both. Similar to other health care professions, obstetrics and gynecology is not without its stresses. According to DeFrancesco, OB-GYNs worry that they might have missed some problem or sign of illness, that an extremely rare tragedy will befall one of their labor and deliveries and that they might be sued for medical malpractice even if they made no mistakes. DeFrancesco says this field is especially vulnerable, since OB-GYN patients are predominantly young and presumably healthy. ""When things go wrong, it is very unexpected,"" he says. Like other fields in medicine, DeFrancesco sees obstetrics and gynecology moving more toward preventing problems rather than just fixing them. ""Studies show that the majority of women in childbearing years only see their OB-GYN on a regular basis and rarely seek out an otherwise designated primary care doctor,"" he explains. So, who better to address health concerns than the OB-GYNs who see these patients regularly? ""We are poised to go beyond the Pap test and the pelvic exam and provide more comprehensive care for our patients,"" DeFrancesco says. ""At least in terms of broader screening for other health conditions, as well as more directly addressing with our patients their weight and other lifestyle choices.""

When they open wide, they're afraid what the dentist will find. Yet another cavity? Or even worse – will it be time for a root canal? Will the dentist embarrass them about their flossing frequency or their coffee drinking? Will they push procedures that patients don't want? According to Ada S. Cooper, a consumer adviser for the American Dental Association and dentist with a private practice in New York City, these concerns are why establishing trust is so important. ""Patients have to know that dentists are doing what's best for them,"" Cooper says. And they can do this by being honest, ethical and compassionate – three qualities Cooper looks for when she is hiring at her practice. She also highlights the importance of good communication skills. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 8.1 percent employment growth for dentists between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 9,800 jobs should open up."
47,Computer Network Architect,6.3,9000,1.2,116780,"Computer network architects design, build and maintain a variety of data communication networks, from expansive cloud infrastructures to smaller intranets. Along with a host of technical skills, computer network architects also have a deep understanding of the company or organization's business plans and objectives. They also need business acumen to do everything from budgeting the network design and implementation to managing a staff. If you've ever saved something to the cloud, then you've depended on the handiwork of a computer network architect. ""You will have to constantly learn,"" says Peter Steenkiste, a professor of computer science and electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ""You need to be very much aware of not just about the technologies available today but about the trends. A lot of the designing of networks is effectively upgrading and expanding the networks."" As companies and firms expand their IT networks, they'll increasingly rely on these professionals to build new networks and upgrade existing ones. The popularity of cloud computing is also expected to drive the need for more computer network architects. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 5.5 percent employment growth for computer network architects between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 9,000 jobs should open up."
48,Licensed Practical and Licensed Vocational Nurse,6.3,63800,3.8,48820,"Licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses check vital signs, perform enemas, install catheters, dress wounds, deliver medicine, massage muscles, assist patients in maintaining their hygiene, help with feeding (for infants to the elderly), start IVs, monitor medical equipment and so much more. There is no health care professional who doesn't perform an essential task, but licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses have a suite of responsibilities that are truly basic yet absolutely imperative for quality medical care. Despite a convoluted name, the true differences between a licensed practical nurse, or an LPN, and a licensed vocational nurse, or an LVN, are ones of semantics and location. LVN is the term for this occupation in California and Texas. Within the nursing hierarchy, LPNs and LVNs usually supervise nursing aides and orderlies, but work under registered nurses and nurse practitioners.The nature of their work means licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses often have the most intimate, hands-on relationship with patients of any other professional in this industry's sphere. Having bedside manner isn't just a catchphrase for this job - it's a necessity for the patient's well-being and for the nurse's career advancement.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 9.3 percent employment growth for licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 63,800 jobs should open up."
49,Wind Turbine Technician,6.2,4700,N/A,56230,"Wind turbine technicians, also known as wind techs, are the professionals in charge of inspecting and maintaining wind turbines. That means that most of their days are spent way up high in a turbine performing maintenance or troubleshooting the turbine's electrical, mechanical or hydraulic components and replacing or fixing malfunctioning components.Auston Van Slyke, former program director of the Wind Energy Technology program at Ecotech Institute in Aurora, Colorado, began thinking about wind turbines in 2006 as a Marine.""I got lost on deployment in Japan and stumbled across these wind turbines,"" Van Slyke says. ""They were massive, hundreds of feet tall, and I guess that's what sparked my interest.""When Van Slyke transitioned out of the military, a career as a wind turbine technician appealed to him. Along with the technical aspect of working on turbines, from the hydraulics to the composites, the profession also offered good pay and benefits, as well as the ability to travel.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 68.2 percent employment growth for wind turbine technicians between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 4,700 jobs should open up."
50,Psychiatrist,6.2,3500,6.2,208000,"Psychiatrists are physicians who diagnose, treat and work to prevent disorders relating to the mind and mental health. Having undergone medical school and psychiatry residency programs, these professionals are equipped to understand the complex relationships between ailments of the mind and body. They are also trained to evaluate the entire spectrum of a patient's health, make a diagnosis and design a treatment plan. Patients might suffer from mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, and receive a form of treatment known as psychotherapy – a fancy word for meetings in which a patient discusses his or her moods, problems and feelings with a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists can also prescribe a wide range of drugs or even recommend hospitalizations. For Judith Orloff, the last thing she wanted to be when she grew up was a doctor – even though she had 25 physicians in the family, including her mom and dad. ""I thought physicians were incredibly nice, but I found them to be a little boring,"" she says. But one day, she heard a voice telling her that she would, in fact, join the family trade. Intrigued, she signed up for a course at a community college, which eventually led to medical school at the University of Southern California, an internship at Wadsworth Veterans Hospital and a residency at the University of California – Los Angeles. Orloff has built her career as a motivational speaker, writer (""Emotional Freedom,"" her book on inner peace, is a New York Times bestseller), an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA and a practicing psychiatrist in Santa Monica, California.Orloff hopes that more psychiatrists will take into account a patient's whole mind, body and spirit when evaluating, diagnosing and treating a patient. ""Integrating traditional medicine with complementary practices like energy work, spiritual beliefs, yoga and meditation is the best road [to treating patients],"" she says. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 12.5 percent employment growth for psychiatrists between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 3,500 jobs should open up."
51,Computer Systems Administrator,6.2,18800,2.1,84810,"Computer systems administrators set up and maintain an organization's computer servers. In a single day, they may encounter stacks of servers, dozens of crisscrossing network cables and major malfunctions with the hardware and software that runs the company's local area and wide area networks. A network and computer systems administrator's greatest contribution is maintaining an organization's work flow and keeping its lines of communication open. This work is not for the faint of heart. Since companies depend on their networks for so much of their work, problems must be corrected swiftly and completely. Aside from identifying network issues and fixing them, computer systems administrators must also make updates to all equipment and software so they're current. Another important aspect of the job is ensuring email and data storage networks work properly and employee workstations are connected to the central computer network. They also train new users on how to use relevant hardware and software. Some network and computer systems administrators also manage telecommunication networks so employees can work from home or on the road, which has become increasingly important in recent years as more employees connect outside the traditional office setting. As its low unemployment rate indicates, this is an in-demand profession that's expected to grow as employers invest in new technology and faster mobile networks. More administrators will also be needed to implement upgraded security measures to protect workplace computer systems. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 5.4 percent employment growth for computer systems administrators between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 18,800 jobs should open up."
52,Sales Manager,6.1,27900,4.5,132290,"Sales managers are responsible for orchestrating a company or organization’s sales team. Their job includes planning how best to utilize available resources, determining and addressing any changes necessary to meet customer needs, and helping their teams improve sales performance.“They have to have a focus on improving the effectiveness of the salespeople in the organization,” says Bob Kelly, chairman and founder of the Sales Management Association. “This has become an increasing part of the sales manager job, and it positions the sales manager as a force multiplier in the organization. This is why sales managers are so important because if they’re effective in this role, they can have a compounding influence in the organization.”A sales manager’s duties can differ depending on the size of their team and whether they work in a business-to-business environment, such as a manufacturer selling to a wholesaler, or a business-to-consumer setting, such as a car dealership or other retail establishment.But regardless of where they work, sales managers generally hire and train salespeople, create plans to attract and retain customers, set sales goals, assign sales territories (if applicable), and complete assigned administrative work. In some cases, they also may deal with customers directly.“It’s less important now that sales managers supervise and sort of make sure employees are doing the right things. We now have a lot of technology that can automate that,” Kelly says. “So the sales manager role as nanny is much less valuable to firms.”The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 7.0 percent employment growth for sales managers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 27,900 jobs should open up."
53,Recreation and Fitness Worker,6.1,179500,17.6,31250,"Recreation and fitness workers are found in various settings, including community centers, public pools, parks, gyms and nursing care facilities. And though many roles fall under the recreation and fitness worker career umbrella, those who work in these jobs have a common cause: to help people stay active and interact with other members of the community they call home.“I engage kids and families in the community by creating fun activities from structured play to cooking, creative exercises and fitness activities,” says Emily Braxton, family programs coordinator for the Arlington County Department of Parks and Recreation in Arlington, Virginia. “Our goals are really to build the community (and) help them stay active and fit and make friends.”The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 27.0 percent employment growth for recreation and fitness workers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 179,500 jobs should open up."
54,Orthodontist,6.1,500,5.5,208000,"Orthodontists are dental specialists who concentrate on fixing irregularities in teeth and jaws. They straighten teeth and help correct problems such as overbites and underbites. If you’ve ever had braces or a retainer to straighten your teeth, you can thank your orthodontist for creating a corrective treatment plan specifically for your needs. “In dental school, I was fascinated with how the face and jaws grow and how the teeth, jaws and a person’s smile affect how they feel about themselves,” says Chris Roberts, 2020-21 American Association of Orthodontists president and adjunct clinical associate professor of dentistry at the University of Michigan. “It takes many years of higher education to become an orthodontist, but it is the most rewarding career I can imagine.”The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 8.1 percent employment growth for orthodontists between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 500 jobs should open up."
55,Orthotist and Prosthetist,6.1,1900,2.3,70190,"""Orthotics"" is the branch of medicine that works with prescribing, making and managing braces or orthoses; ""prosthetics"" is the branch of medicine that works with prescribing, making and managing artificial body parts or prostheses.""My uncle lost his arm in a hang gliding accident in his young adult years,"" says Phil Stevens. ""Growing up, I have vivid memories of watching him button his shirts and eat cornflakes with his prosthesis."" That experience led Stevens down a path to becoming a practicing orthotist and prosthetist and eventually, president of the American Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists. Today, Stevens works with patients who range in age from infants to geriatrics. He might see a child with spina bifida who needs external braces (or orthoses) to walk. He might see adults with disabilities, such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries. He also might work with patients who have sports injuries and who need braces to recover after a cast is removed. He'll see patients who were born without a limb – or without part of a limb. Other patients might have had a limb amputated because of cancer, diabetes or another illness. Stevens says he might see eight to 12 patients a day, but if it's an especially complicated case, it might be just one patient. When a patient comes to Stevens, he'll work in conjunction with the referring physician to assess the patient's physical abilities and interests. He then determines which type of prosthetic components or orthoses will be the best fit for his patients. Stevens describes his job as ""matching the most appropriate technology with the needs and capabilities of the individual."" In addition to determining the design of specific braces or prostheses, Stevens' job entails applying them to the skin, or creating a socket or ""custom interface that bears weight."" The real magic happens in the finishing touches. In New Orleans in early 2015, Stevens gave a speech to a group of O&P professionals at The Academy Annual Meeting and Scientific Symposium. There, he spoke about going the extra mile. ""I'm really speaking of those extra actions that we take during patient encounters,"" he says. ""When we look down and realize that if we took another quarter-inch off that foot plate, it would fit in the shoe a little easier, or when we ask for one more pass down the parallel bars and we give that wrench another quarter-turn to see if we can't improve the alignment."" The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 18.4 percent employment growth for orthotists and prosthetists between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 1,900 jobs should open up."
56,Social and Community Service Manager,6.1,26400,3.9,69600,"Social and community service managers' work can take a number of shapes: They might work directly with a specific community, such as the homeless or the seriously ill, and seek to identify problems and gaps in services for that population. They might also research and design programs that address these problems. Analyzing data, writing grant proposals, and overseeing and mentoring staff are also part of the job. By acting as the voice for their particular community, they could speak to government officials about certain problems; they might even testify before Congress on behalf of their demographic.""I think we need to feel that what we do matters,"" says Shirley Otis-Green, clinical director of consulting services for the Coalition for Compassionate Care of California, an advocacy organization dedicated to improving the care of the seriously ill. ""Social work, by its very definition, is about doing work that matters. It has an inherent sense of purpose that is so rewarding.""Otis-Green is hopeful that, in the future, social and community service managers will increasingly collaborate interprofessionally so that services will be more holistic. She gives the example of oncology patients. ""The most effective way to deliver health care is with a team approach that includes a nurse, doctor, chaplain and social worker,"" she says. ""Person-centered care recognizes that there are multidimensional aspects of suffering and that an interprofessional perspective is needed to address the patient's physical, social, psychological and spiritual needs.""The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 15.2 percent employment growth for social and community service managers between 2020 and 2030.

57,Massage Therapist,6.1,46500,17.6,43620,"Employing their unique set of tools – ""magic hands"" and a ""magic touch"" – massage therapists relieve pain, reduce stress, unwind bound-up muscles and just plain make people feel better. With more than 80 types of treatments, massage therapists have many different ways to deliver this relief. Massage therapists can specialize in deep-tissue, acupressure, reflexology, orthopedic, sports massage and other areas. Often, massage therapists become experts in several modalities, all of which require specific skills and techniques. The length and type of massage provided typically depends on the client's condition and desires. Elderly clients, pregnant women and those recovering from a severe injury usually receive different treatments than elite athletes or those simply seeking relaxation. The nature of the massage is often discussed and agreed upon during a short interview with the client before it takes place. Massage therapists work for employers in a variety of environments, including spas and hospitals, and some are self-employed with their own small businesses. Regardless of the working arrangement, massage therapists should be friendly and personable to attract a consistent client base. Want a job that aims, above all else, to make people feel better? Consider becoming a massage therapist. The increasing number of spas and massage clinics in recent years underscores a growing demand for massage services.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 32.2 percent employment growth for massage therapists between 2020 and 2030.

58,Mechanical Engineer,6.1,20900,4.1,90160,"Mechanical engineers research, design, develop, build and test various devices.They often have an innate curiosity about the way things work. For J. Robert Sims, former president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, this curiosity reared its head at age 10. ""I repaired an old radio and used an old power supply to experiment with the electrolysis of water. I produced a small amount of hydrogen that I proceeded to ignite,"" he wrote in an email. ""Good judgment is not inherent in the young – that comes later with experience.""An enthusiasm for solving problems is a vital trait of mechanical engineers, says Warren Seering, a professor of mechanical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It takes creativity to shepherd a theoretical device into a practical reality. Computers have changed the way mechanical engineers do their work. Computing tools now ""allow complex analyses to be performed in seconds that once required days or weeks of hand calculations,"" Sims writes. But to produce a fully refined product, mechanical engineers use grittier items, such as electric generators, industrial production equipment and material-handling systems. When confronted with the more complex and analytical portions of the occupation, being a wiz in areas like calculus and trigonometry is a major advantage.Mechanical engineering is an exciting professional field, thanks to innovations like 3D printing and the development of new engineering materials like carbon fiber composites. And as a result of globalization, Seering says many mechanical engineers now work in teams and create designs for communities throughout the world.Architecture, alternative energies, remanufacturing and nanotechnology are subsets of this profession that will have openings for candidates with the right education and experience. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 7.0 percent employment growth for mechanical engineers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 20,900 jobs should open up."
59,Clinical Laboratory Technician,6.0,36500,4.4,54180,"Clinical laboratory technicians are responsible for a number of tasks, including examining body fluids and cells and matching blood for transfusions. The job requires the use of sophisticated laboratory equipment, such as microscopes and cell counters. With continued advancements in technology, lab work has become more analytical, so laboratory personnel should have excellent judgment skills. More complex procedures are reserved for clinical laboratory technologists, who must possess a bachelor's degree. Technicians, who must hold at least an associate degree, often work under the supervision of technologists. Don't expect to see clinical laboratory technicians playing a leading role on ""Grey's Anatomy"" anytime soon. Leave the spotlight to the actors who play surgeons; clinical lab technicians, on the other hand, are content working hard behind the scenes. Serving as an important cog in the elaborate framework that is the modern hospital or clinic, they conduct the crucial tests and analyses that physicians use to make their diagnoses.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 10.9 percent employment growth for clinical laboratory technicians between 2020 and 2030.

60,Psychologist,6.0,1100,0.9,105780,"Psychologists observe patients to glean insights about how they think, feel and behave. David Scheinfeld, a psychologist working in Austin, Texas, got his start in psychology at a young age. “I was in therapy myself as a young child through my teenage years, and I still am,” Scheinfeld says. “At a fundamental level, I found a lot of importance in therapy – the way it helps provide direction to live a valued life.” After completing a double major in psychology and communication studies in undergrad, Scheinfeld earned a doctorate in psychology. These days, Scheinfeld works with geriatric patients at a rehabilitation facility during the day. In the morning, he attends an interdisciplinary meeting with nurses, physical therapists, physicians and social workers. After this, he makes his rounds; those patients who might be experiencing major life crises will come first. He’ll generally spend anywhere from 25 to 50 minutes with each patient, and he’ll see anywhere from eight to 14 patients a day. Outside working hours, he’s involved with several innovative psychology programs, including Outward Bound for Veterans, an organization that facilitates outdoor therapeutic adventures for veterans, as well as Project Rebirth, “resilience” programs aimed at caring for the psychological health of the military, veterans and first responders. “This field is not stagnant; there’s so many new and innovative ways to approach treating the mental health issues,” Scheinfeld says. “You can start in one place and end in another place.

""A landscaper is more involved with the horticultural maintenance of facilities, while a groundsworker might be involved with refuse removal and snow removal,"" says Donald Bottger, director of facility and environmental services for the San Diego Convention Center Corporation.  Other landscaper duties include planting trees and shrubbery, fertilizing and watering plants and constructing patios and walkways. And groundskeepers' work isn't confined to greenery; they might maintain swimming pools and fountains or ensure picnic areas and public spaces are free of litter. Both jobs are ideal for green thumbs and outdoorsy folks, and they're also good callings for those who have the entrepreneurial spirit to start their own lawn care and landscaping businesses. Bottger says there is plenty of potential for advancement in this career – landscapers could move up the ranks and become supervisors, while groundskeepers could be promoted to grounds managers or facilities managers.From manicured lawns on college campuses to ornate gardens at historic homes, the work of landscapers and groundskeepers surrounds us. You'll also find their handiwork in public parks, botanical gardens, sports fields and even cemeteries.  Aging baby boomers aren't just driving demand for more professionals in the health care field – they also influence job openings within landscaping and groundskeeping. Older homeowners often employ lawn care services when they can no longer tend to their homes themselves. These services are also popular among working professionals who have limited daytime hours available for yard work.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 7.6 percent employment growth for landscapers and groundskeepers between 2020 and 2030.

It's the job of the physical therapist assistant to carry out that plan. Their work can include manually maneuvering a patient's body for different massages or stretches prescribed to relieve damages incurred by disease or injury. Or they might explain different exercises and observe the patients while they do them. They might also use different equipment or machines to help with therapy. Years ago, Chris Garland's mother underwent ACL surgery. In the days that followed, Garland took her mother to physical therapy appointments. ""I sat back and watched,"" she says. What she saw was science and problem-solving in action. She saw compassionate physical therapists and physical therapist assistants building relationships with their patients and helping them reach their fullest potential. Garland was hooked. After more than 15 years of working in marketing, Garland went back to school, earned an associate degree in Applied Science and became a physical therapist assistant. ""I kicked myself for not doing this sooner,"" she says.

64,Petroleum Engineer,6.0,2200,N/A,137330,"Petroleum engineers design equipment that extracts oil from reservoirs, which are deep pockets of rock that contain oil and gas deposits. To do this, they spend a lot of time gathering and analyzing data to extract the oil in the safest and most cost-effective ways possible. They also do a lot of evaluating and refining of systems to make them better. A decent amount of the oil extracted by petroleum engineers in the U.S. comes from Texas.As a kid growing up in West Texas, Russell Parker wanted nothing to do with oil. He saw what happened during the mid-1980s bust when the price of crude oil, or petroleum, plummeted, and more than 200,000 people lost their jobs.  But, while working on his bachelor's degree at the University of Texas at Austin, Parker found himself bored in his aeronautical engineering classes. He wanted to work in an area of engineering that moved at a faster clip and pushed the envelope. As it turned out, petroleum engineering fit the bill. Parker, now the CEO of Houston-based Phoenix Natural Resources, says the job includes a lot of science, data and technical know-how, but there's always this exciting element of the unknown.  ""You can't put a human being two miles into the earth,"" Parker says.

They help their clients by recommending when to buy and sell investments and by staying current on economic trends, business news and company strategy. They also write reports that explain their analyses, share their expertise with colleagues who aren’t financial experts and sometimes communicate their perspectives to the public and financial media. Many work for financial companies, including those in the financial services and insurance industries. For their influence and sizable paychecks, financial analysts pay the price by working long hours: One in three put in between 50 and 70 hours a week.Competition for these jobs is fierce, especially among analysts new to the field.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 6.4 percent employment growth for financial analysts between 2020 and 2030.

67,Computer Support Specialist,5.9,58000,5,52690,"Computer support specialists help with log-in difficulties, operating system and software malfunctions and some even need to pull out a screwdriver to open up a laptop or PC. Considering the number of phone calls, face-to-face meetings, emails and, in some cases, chats they engage in on a daily basis, people in this line of work must exhibit excellent communication skills. They need to ask users the right questions to pinpoint the issue, find a solution and then guide them step-by-step through the fix. Almost everyone has thrown up their hands in frustration after what feels like a million failed attempts to log onto their computer or more than an hour wrestling with a router to set up a home network. When you reach for the phone or keyboard to seek assistance and a little peace of mind, the person who answers on the other end is typically a computer support specialist. These tech savants work in a variety of settings – from traditional offices to universities to call centers – but the primary goal of the men and women who field often frantic pleas for help from users with computer issues is always the same: to provide the assistance they need in a friendly and effective manner. ""We need to make sure we know how to diagnose their issues and do it quickly,"" says Guido Diaz, a distributed computer systems analyst at the Florida Department of Education. ""Customer relations and troubleshooting are very important.""  Instead of responding to general requests for assistance, another segment of computer support specialists hone in on network matters. Referred to as computer network support specialists, these professionals receive their fair share of distressed phone calls and emails, but they often revolve around network problems and come from employees within their workplace rather than customers or the public. Aside from responding to and solving issues in a timely manner, network support specialists troubleshoot an organization's network computer system to ferret out potential problems and provide regular maintenance to ensure all its components function properly. As organizations upgrade outdated hardware, software and network equipment and require more experienced, knowledgeable professionals to respond to questions from users, computer support specialists will remain an in-demand job. The one blemish on this industry's job outlook: The recent rise in cloud computing could increase computer support specialists' productivity, therefore reducing the number of employees that organizations need to employ.

Who can forget Geico's gecko with that adorable British accent, Allstate's memorable ""Mayhem"" character or the catchy jingle ""Nationwide is on your side""? About half of insurance agents work for an independent insurance agency or brokerage, and sell the products of many insurance companies. Nearly 20 percent are self-employed. Others work for direct insurance carriers. Commissions are an important source of income for most agents, although a smaller number hold salaried positions. Agents spend considerable time developing and pursuing sales leads. Consumer policy agents do a lot of telephone and office work, while commercial agents are more likely to be out in the field with customers. Independent agents who work for a brokerage may have irregular hours, but they also have more control over their work schedules than agents who work for an insurance company or spend most of their time in an office. There tends to be a lot of turnover in this career because many new agents struggle to earn sufficient commission income and switch to other occupations. Prospects for insurance agents are closely tied to the growth of the broader economy.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 7.0 percent employment growth for insurance sales agents between 2020 and 2030.

They also develop plans for addressing these issues and refer students to other mental health resources when necessary. Their job duties are varied. These mental health professionals might help students manage stress, such as high school seniors applying to colleges. They might role-play with students on the autism spectrum. Or, they might counsel and refer a student who has expressed suicidal thoughts. They also might discuss a student's anxiety and depression issues with a concerned parent or guardian. And these professionals must handle a copious amount of documentation and paperwork. Pamela Agan-Smith, a school psychologist who has worked with students in the Greenville Central School District in Greenville, New York, for more than 30 years, says the biggest issues facing her students these days involve mental health. ""Public school students face a pretty stressful environment,"" she notes. For some students, this stress morphs into anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts, and the school psychologist is the point person to address these concerns. A heightened awareness of mental health's connection to learning and the rising need of mental health services in schools are driving the demand for more school psychologists. However, this demand is tempered by state and local funding for schools, which is inadequate in some cases.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 10.4 percent employment growth for school psychologists between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 12,300 jobs should open up."
70,Genetic Counselor,5.9,600,4.3,85700,"Imagine a biology teacher teaming up with a therapist, and you'll start to picture what a genetic counselor does. A genetic counselor combs through a patient's family tree to highlight any potential health risks. For example, a person with a family history of cancer might meet with a genetic counselor to determine his or her risk for receiving similar diagnoses. If a patient decides to move forward with a genetic test, the counselor then coordinates laboratory work – usually a blood test – for a clearer picture of any genetic risks. Next comes the interpretation, where the counselor examines test results to look for any mutations that might explain a current disorder or syndrome, or that might predict future ones. The counselor then sits with the patient and his or her family to explain the findings and their ramifications. If necessary, genetic counselors also discuss the ways in which the information might be used in a patient's medical care.  Joy Larsen Haidle, president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors and a genetic counselor with the Humphrey Cancer Center in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, says the profession is a ""great blend of science, critical thinking, psychology and counseling."" If patients are considering a genetic test for a certain disorder, Larsen Haidle asks them to consider if it's a piece of information they really want to know. How would a patient use the information in their future plans? ""This conversation helps a patient feel more empowered with the information rather than a gene or the cancer being in control,"" she says.  The first genetic counselors graduated with master's degrees in 1971 from Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York. They went on to work with the prenatal population, assessing genetic conditions in the womb. Since then, with advances in genomics and laboratory technology – not to mention the increased awareness that celebrities like Angelina Jolie have brought to the benefits of using genetic counseling to take preventive health measures – the profession has proliferated. Larsen Haidle says there are roles for counselors to play in any subspecialty, from psychiatry to cardiology. Technological advances have also boosted the type of testing genetic counselors may administer and interpret. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 26.2 percent employment growth for genetic counselors between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 600 jobs should open up."
71,Chiropractor,5.9,5600,3.4,70720,"Chiropractors care for patients ailing from problems with their musculoskeletal systems. This purview is perhaps broader than it might sound because this includes nerves, bones, muscles, ligaments and tendons. These professionals use spinal adjustments and manual manipulations to address these concerns. Chiropractors will also often advise patients on lifestyle issues, including exercise, nutrition and sleep. Dr. Robert Hayden, a spokesperson for the American Chiropractic Association and owner of a private practice in Griffin, Georgia, spent 18 years as a critical care nurse before making the switch to chiropractic. ""I've been very blessed to have two careers that I really enjoyed and loved,"" Hayden says. ""I probably had some degree of burnout – not with what I did in critical care. You're confined in a room with a very sick patient and hissing ventilators, IV pumps, bouncing green balls. It was very stressful, though I enjoyed it."" But he was enjoying the hospital politics less and less. Right about that time, Hayden was attending a Bible study group, and he watched one of the members hobble into the house where they were meeting. The man was suffering from so much sciatic pain that he couldn't sit on a chair; rather, he perched awkwardly on the ground. At the end of the meeting, another member, who was a chiropractor, adjusted some of this man's lumbar bones and the man was able to stand up nearly straight and walk out of the house. ""With the knowledge in his head and skill in his hand, [that doctor] was able to take pain away,"" Hayden says. ""I was fascinated."" Eventually, Hayden was fascinated enough to go back to school and begin a second career. Interestingly, chiropractic was also the answer to Hayden's annoyance with office politics. ""I wanted to create my own little microcosm of health care that was holistic, patient-centered and user-friendly, and I knew that I couldn't do that anywhere other than private practice."" The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 10.8 percent employment growth for chiropractors between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 5,600 jobs should open up."
72,Pharmacist,5.9,-7000,1.3,128710,"The white-coated professionals at your neighborhood drug store do a lot more than just fill prescriptions. Pharmacists do indeed dispense medicines, but first they check for any possible interactions with other medicines or medical conditions. They also instruct patients on how to take the medicines and will inform them about what to do if certain side effects arise. A pharmacist will also keep meticulous records, coordinate with insurance companies, supervise pharmacy technicians and keep up-to-date with continuing education courses.""Pharmacists are becoming a more integral part of the health care team,"" says Heather Free, a pharmacist working in the District of Columbia. She says that pharmacists are doing more to support doctors and clinicians, for example, by giving patients immunizations and making sure that all of a patient's doctors are informed about the diverse medicines that have been prescribed. Some pharmacists are also getting involved in adherence monitoring (why it's hard for patients to take their meds) and medication therapy management, which seeks to optimize what drugs do for a patient's overall well-being.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects -2.2 percent employment growth for pharmacists between 2020 and 2030.

73,Electrician,5.9,66100,6.2,56900,"Electricians are responsible for the installation, maintenance and repair of electrical systems in buildings, including homes, factories, offices and retail stores. They install wiring systems, outlets and light switches; inspect circuit breakers and transformers; and repair and replace wiring when needed.“The electricians in our program can be doing anything from residential to commercial to industrial wiring,” says Derrick Atkins, training director at Minneapolis Electrical Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee. The Minneapolis Electrical JATC operates a nonprofit training center for electricians in St. Michael, Minnesota, a collaboration between the Minneapolis chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 292.Electricians work in a variety of settings and specialties – basically, anywhere electricity is used. Atkins says there are different opportunities in all kinds of areas from solar and renewables, to building automation, and residential or commercial wiring.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 9.1 percent employment growth for electricians between 2020 and 2030.

74,Dietitian and Nutritionist,5.9,7800,4.5,63090,"Dietitians and nutritionists are experts in food and nutrition, and they advise clients how to eat in order to achieve a desired goal, whether that's losing weight or managing a chronic condition such as diabetes. Their clients might include low-income people who need to eat right on a budget. A large segment of dietitians and nutritionists are employed by hospitals to provide medical nutrition therapy and support. Evelyn Crayton, director at Living Well Associates and former president of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, started down her career path because, as she puts it, ""a man who would be considered sexist now"" pointed her in the right direction.  Crayton, who attended Grambling State University in the 1960s, excelled in her science classes, and one of her professors wanted to give her some advice. He suggested that, instead of becoming a professor, she should consider home economics because men wanted their women to cook, clean and have children. She wasn't offended. ""This was the '60s,"" Crayton laughs. ""We hadn't become liberated women yet.""  Nonetheless, she took his advice and visited the university's Institute Management department, where she excelled in dietitian courses that eventually helped her acquire a coveted internship at St. Louis University. Graduate and doctorate degrees followed, as did a career that included clinical jobs, research and mentoring the next generation of professionals.  Crayton wishes her late mother could see her career trajectory. ""People told her I was a cook,"" she says. ""They didn't really know (what I did as a dietitian and nutritionist).""

75,Actor,5.8,16700,N/A,43760,"Actors perform in the theater, work in films or star in television productions. Their job is to interpret a writer's script and portray different characters on the stage or on the screen to a watching public. Their job involves reading scripts, auditioning, researching their characters, memorizing and rehearsing lines, and performing their roles. Much of the job of an actor involves looking for work, and sometimes it involves long bouts of unemployment while waiting for a break.  When he was a kid, Arbender Robinson's family moved around a lot. To make matters worse, Robinson was a self-proclaimed bookworm with a stutter. But in fourth grade at Richmond Grade School in Richmond, Illinois, all of that started to change. In an effort to draw him out of his shell, one of his teachers put him in the elementary school musical. ""It was horrible,"" Robinson says with a laugh.  But then Robinson says he fell in love with the sense of responsibility that memorizing his lines gave him, the teamwork that belonging to the cast gave him, and the sheer fun of it all.  “All of a sudden those values that parents, teachers, mentors and family tried to teach were all coming into play at one time,” Robinson says.  One well-intentioned teacher's social experiment not only gave Robinson some confidence, but it also pointed him down his future career path. After high school, Robinson studied theater at Viterbo University in La Crosse, Wisconsin. He got jobs as a vocalist and an actor with Royal Caribbean Cruises and Walt Disney World, before moving to New York City, where he earned parts in Broadway shows like ""Hairspray."" Robinson has also worked in the Broadway revival of ""Shuffle Along.""The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 32.4 percent employment growth for actors between 2020 and 2030.

76,Security Guard,5.8,154200,7.7,31050,"Security guards protect people against fire, theft, vandalism, terrorism, and other illegal and dangerous threats. They ensure safety by actively patrolling or using security systems to keep a watchful eye over a facility. Like police officers, many security guards are armed with weapons. Specific tasks vary by setting. Transportation guards use detectors to screen passengers, while security guards at casinos look out for cheating and underage gamblers. Although movies give security guards a bad rap by depicting frequent snoozing on the job, in reality, there's little downtime in this line of work, as guards must remain alert to watch for any suspicious activity.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 14.6 percent employment growth for security guards between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 154,200 jobs should open up."
77,Pilot,5.8,14700,9.5,130440,"Pilots fly and operate aircraft like airplanes and helicopters for airlines, private corporations, law enforcement agencies and the military. They also prepare the aircraft for flight, which includes ensuring there are no mechanical defects with the aircraft, verifying that scheduled maintenance is done and any repairs are complete, and checking the route of flight as well as departure, destination and alternate airports to make sure the flight is safe for weather conditions. Pilots also make sure the aircraft is properly balanced with passengers, cargo, baggage and fuel load.“You may be within your weight limitation, but if the balance is out, it can be very difficult to raise the nose or raise the tail if the center of gravity is off, just like on a teeter-totter,” says David Dornacker, flight simulator and academic ground school instructor at CAE USA, a major defense contractor that provides flight simulation training for the military. Dornacker was previously a pilot with ExpressJet Airlines (formerly Continental Express) for 14 years, where he served as first officer then captain, and prior to that was an air traffic controller with the U.S. Navy for 20 years.Getting the aircraft ready for takeoff is “not just a matter of loading up the aircraft and topping it off and going. You’ve got to actually have a plan; you have to know how much fuel you’re going to burn to get to your destination, you have to have reserve fuel left over to be compliant with federal air regulations, and should you need an alternate, you’ve got to have enough fuel to get to that alternate airport and then have adequate fuel reserves on board as well,” Dornacker says.Once preflight duties have been performed, pilots have the arduous job of getting the aircraft safely in the sky. Dornacker says the pilot files the route of flight, requests clearance from the air traffic controllers, takes position on the runway, runs through final checks for the aircraft, runs the power-up check on the engines, and then climbs out at the appropriate speed to get to the assigned cruising altitude.The Bureau of Labor Statistics groups pilots into two categories: airline and commercial. Airline pilots generally work on a fixed schedule for an airline as they transport people and cargo to their destinations. Commercial pilots typically perform unscheduled flights for corporations, wealthy individuals, aerial tours, charter flights and pesticide application.Ambulance services is expected to be a large area of growth among commercial pilots in the next decade, according to the BLS, as pilots will be hired to transport patients to hospitals and other health care facilities. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 12.9 percent employment growth for pilots between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 14,700 jobs should open up."
78,Audiologist,5.8,2100,N/A,81030,"Audiologists assess hearing and balance with tools like audiometers, and give treatment, which may mean different relief procedures for vertigo or fitting hearing aids for hearing impairments. Audiologists also counsel a patient's family or community on how to best serve a patient with hearing impairments or balance issues.The combination of helping people and the technology interested Neil DiSarno, who always knew he wanted to make a career out of helping people but didn't know just how he could.In college, he took a class on communication disorders and then shadowed an audiologist at the workplace. What he saw hooked him. ""Patients were generally very grateful,"" DiSarno says. ""I liked that you got to work with all ages – newborns to nursing homes. I liked the technology. I liked the machinery. It was a match for me.""These days, DiSarno is the chief staff officer for audiology at the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Before that, he worked for several decades testing patients' hearing and balance and treating them for hearing disorders. His career in clinical practice and teaching has taken him to Alaska, New Zealand, New York, Florida, Missouri and the Washington, D.C., area.Because the incidences of hearing loss increase with age, audiologists will likely be more in need as the baby boomers age. Newborns with hearing issues are also expected to drive job growth because hearing disorders can be detected and diagnosed early.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 15.7 percent employment growth for audiologists between 2020 and 2030.

81,Radiation Therapist,5.8,1600,N/A,86850,"Radiation therapists carry out radiation treatment plans created by radiation oncologists and dosimetrists. These professionals work with CAT scans, X-rays and Cone beam computed tomography before radiation is even administered. These technologies enable them to accurately position cancer patients so that the radiation is administered precisely. They also use immobilization devices so that each time a patient comes in for radiation, they can replicate the patient's position for the sake of accurate treatment. Radiation therapists are experts on computer technologies, which will appropriate the correct doses of radiation to the radiation machine. They constantly monitor their patients, and they detail their treatment. Dorothy Hargrove, chief radiation therapist at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, says she became interested in the field while she was earning her associate degree. Early in her program, she realized that general X-ray wasn't for her. ""I didn't like that I didn't get to know my patients very well,"" Hargrove says. But four months before she was due to graduate, Hargrove took an elective course in radiation therapy that changed her life. ""I watched therapists who knew their patients by name,"" Hargrove says. ""You got to know patients and be a part of their recovery, and that was so different than general X-ray. It was love at first patient.""These days, Hargrove manages a team of radiation therapists. She's worked as a radiation therapist for more than 22 years, treating cancer patients with radiation. ""It's a perfect balance between patient care and great technology,"" she says.Earlier cancer diagnoses and new technologies are driving the need for more radiation therapists. The aging population is also precipitating this demand, since the risk of cancer increases with age.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 9.1 percent employment growth for radiation therapists between 2020 and 2030.

A hygienist’s daily tasks may include cleaning patients’ teeth, applying sealants and fluorides, and taking dental X-rays. Hygienists also educate patients on best dental practices, as well as products to use for clean and healthy mouths.But dental hygiene goes beyond the traditional dentist’s office. The emergence of medical and dental integration has changed the field significantly over the last few years. Dental hygienists are sometimes incorporated into full medical teams, such as in hospitals and nursing homes. Dental hygienists are focused on “not allowing disease to occur, because we know how to prevent it,” Crespin says. Their emphasis on preventive health may include patient assessment, disease diagnosis, and treatment planning and implementation.Some may take a research route, focusing on disease prevention.

Today, human resources training specialists operate under this same assumption.   ""Human resources jobs may literally involve any aspect of an employer's workforce,"" says Nancy H. Segal, owner of HR consulting firm Solutions for the Workplace LLC. ""There's enough variety for everyone, and each specialty requires a different knowledge base.""  Jobs often include flexible hours and telecommuting, and involve collaborating with project teams and employees based outside the office. Companies are now developing training initiatives that don't require workers to sit in a room for hours at a time. Technology and online resources are included in the process, which helps make training more inclusive for telecommuting employees. As a result, training and development specialists are needed to introduce new staff to company policies using these methods. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 10.8 percent employment growth for hr specialists between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 35,500 jobs should open up."
92,Ophthalmic Medical Technician,5.7,8700,4.9,37940,"Ophthalmic medical technicians complete the initial portion of the patient's eye examination, which involves taking the patient history, reviewing a patient's systemic medical health and medications, checking visual acuity, testing confrontational visual fields, assessing pupils and the ocular muscles, measuring intraocular pressure and performing refractometry. Christine McDonald, former president of the Association of Technical Personnel in Ophthalmology, refers to the start of her very rewarding career in ophthalmology as a ""happy circumstance."" A friend told McDonald about a job opening at the ophthalmology practice where she worked. After researching ophthalmology (McDonald didn't know what it was) and giving her friend four follow-up calls, she interviewed and got a job working in the front office, answering phones, scheduling patients and filing. Eventually, she was supervising the front office, handling the billing and scheduling patients' surgeries.She really enjoyed working with the patients, and says she was fortunate that the ophthalmologist at the practice liked to teach. ""He would invite me to look through a slit-lamp or hold an eyelid open for him. ... I was hooked right away; I found the field fascinating,"" McDonald says.After a decade at this practice, McDonald moved on to a larger practice where she could advance her skills. She also went on to acquire several certifications necessary for advancing in this field.The trajectory is actually quite common, as most ophthalmic medical technicians receive on-the-job training rather than acquiring any formal training. Yet, these professionals provide a great service to patients and doctors. ""Technicians also perform various types of special testing, imaging and assist in minor procedures. They are often in charge of sending prescriptions to pharmacies and triaging patient phone calls,"" McDonald says.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 14.3 percent employment growth for ophthalmic medical technicians between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 8,700 jobs should open up."
93,Mental Health Counselor,5.7,18500,4.3,48720,"Mental health counselors work in roles that range from treating individuals in outpatient settings to educating communities about mental health.As a mental health counselor, “you're not just eliminating disease; you're promoting wellness,” says Eric Beeson, a clinical associate professor at Northwestern University and former president of the American Mental Health Counselors Association. “It's not, 'How do we get you unsick?' It's, ‘How do we get you well?’”The approach mental health counselors bring to their work comes from training based in “a wellness and human development framework,” Beeson says. That framework “prepares us well to work with individuals, groups and families across the lifespan in traditional clinical settings, providing diagnosis, psychotherapy, clinical mental health counseling, prevention (and) aftercare support.”Mental health counselors can work in a variety of settings. While some work in or start private practices, others provide care at the community level or in settings such as inpatient residential programs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 14.9 percent employment growth for mental health counselors between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 18,500 jobs should open up."
94,Elementary School Teacher,5.7,101700,5.3,60940,"Elementary school teachers build a special bond with their students as they watch them grow and learn throughout the year. With little kids constantly on the go, jumping, playing and laughing, this line of work requires boundless energy. These educators are knowledgeable about a variety of subjects, as many design lesson plans across subjects to teach their students the basics of reading, writing and mathematics.  They also frequently work one-on-one with students to assess their abilities and challenge them to overcome any weaknesses. Many elementary school teachers take a playful approach, using props, games and songs to actively engage their students. It's their job to not only create an academic and fun environment for the kids, but to also interact with the parents to communicate the students' progress. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 7.4 percent employment growth for elementary school teachers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 101,700 jobs should open up."
95,MRI Technologist,5.6,3400,3.8,74690,"MRI technologists operate big tube-like machines that use a magnetic field and radio waves to make images of patients' organs, tissue and bones. These images help doctors diagnose certain medical issues like aneurysms, strokes, tumors and heart attack damage, among other conditions. MRI technology is Teri Blair's second career. ""I was in data processing way back when,"" she says, but then she married a Marine, moved around several times and had kids. In her early 30s, she decided to go into health care. She was thinking about nursing, but decided instead on radiography. ""Interestingly, I'm back working at computers, but I've never regretted the move,"" says Blair, an MRI technologist at the Mayo Clinic. Interacting with patients is a big part of the job too. ""Basically we're asking [patients] not to move for 30 minutes to an hour in a strange, scary environment,"" Blair says. For that reason, MRI technologists should be good communicators and passionate about patient care. She also says that good MRI techs are assertive, attentive and detail-oriented. Growth in this job is driven by an aging population, who will increasingly require MRI techs to operate and maintain diagnostic equipment after bone fractures and breaks caused from osteoporosis. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 8.1 percent employment growth for mri technologists between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 3,400 jobs should open up."
96,Medical Secretary,5.6,64900,4.9,37350,"Medical secretaries manage the daily ebb and flow of patients through a doctor's office. Whether they greet you upon arrival or work behind the scenes, ensuring shot records are in order, scanning insurance cards and collecting copayments, these professionals manage a fast-paced and often hectic environment. Medical secretaries may also assist with medical reports, take medical histories, arrange hospitalization and order surgical or medical supplies, in addition to answering phones and directing patients. ""On an average Monday, we answer up to 500-plus phone calls,"" says Ruth Scott of her former role as support and reception team leader at Medical Associates of Northern New Mexico. ""At any given time, we have six to eight receptionists on the phone, checking people in and out. We can see up to 134 patients-plus a day."" Medical secretaries may work at outpatient care centers, in physicians' offices and hospitals or in the offices of other health practitioners, such as chiropractors and optometrists.The rapid growth of the health care industry and an expected increase in demand for medical services by aging baby boomers will bolster job prospects for medical secretaries in the coming years. Job prospects are particularly good for those looking to work in physicians' offices and surgical hospitals.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 10.6 percent employment growth for medical secretaries between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 64,900 jobs should open up."
97,Taxi Driver,5.6,180600,26,32320,"Taxi drivers get passengers where they need to go with minimal hassle. Generally, they use a meter to determine fares and may pick up passengers who have requested a cab through the central dispatch or who are waiting for a ride at airports, train stations and hotels. In big cities, cab drivers frequently pick up passengers who hail them on the street. And these days, passengers may even ""e-hail"" cabs using smartphone apps. If you're a taxi driver, you never know who might get into the back of your cab – you could drive a family with kids, a political figure or a circus clown.The rise in ride-hailing apps, like Lyft and Uber, has added more options for people to get around. Passengers use a smartphone app to request a ride, and they're made aware of the fare before they take the trip. Unlike a taxi service, drivers for ride-hailing apps use their own vehicles to transport riders.Meanwhile, prearranged trips are typically the domain of chauffeurs. These drivers may work exclusively for one individual, company or government agency, or they may be hired for single trips. Chauffeurs still drive the stretch limos we all associate with the profession, but they also commonly drive other luxury cars, SUVs and vans. Companies that provide chauffeurs tout their customer service, so a pleasant demeanor is an especially important quality for these employees. Aggressive drivers with a lead foot or a tendency to tailgate and cut off other drivers need not apply.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 25.5 percent employment growth for taxi drivers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 180,600 jobs should open up."
98,Community Health Worker,5.6,13500,3.1,42000,"Community health workers are the health advocates for their communities. They work with both their community and health professionals to provide health and promote wellness. As such, a CHW's job can take on many forms. At-risk kids, the HIV population and prospective college students are just a few examples of groups they help.Durrell Fox grew up in poverty. Although social justice and community development were his passions, he wanted to make a decent salary to help his family. ""At that time, I didn't know of any good paying jobs working with youth or doing community outreach,"" he writes in an email. So, Fox went to business school, got his bachelor's degree in business administration and went to work at a telephone company. And he hated it. What he enjoyed was the volunteering he was doing with youth in Boston. So, after a few years of hating his job and loving his volunteering, Fox quit his job with the telephone company and went to work at a community health center, suffering a 50% pay cut to do so. Since then, he has assumed many job titles, including outreach coordinator, outreach educator, community liaison, project director and co-facilitator. But in essence, he was a community health worker all along, before the term was even coined back in 2000.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 21.0 percent employment growth for community health workers between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 13,500 jobs should open up."
99,Nurse Midwife,5.6,800,N/A,111130,"Nurse midwives are advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) who see women of all ages for annual exams, regular pregnancy exams, menopausal care and more. You could say this profession is similar to that of an obstetrician and gynecologist, although there are some significant differences. A nurse midwife is a registered nurse who has a graduate degree in midwifery, whereas an obstetrician and gynecologist has completed medical school and a residency program that qualifies him or her to perform surgeries. This means nurse midwives are equipped to handle normal pregnancies, but only an obstetrician and gynecologist could perform a cesarean section, for example. The writers of the BBC period drama ""Call the Midwife"" might have said it best when they opened their fourth season with the lines, ""Birth is the smallest of magnificent things and the greatest of little ones. … [For midwives] each one was as ordinary and magical as the sunrise, as familiar and different as a breaking day.""   Still, many women turn to midwives because they want a drug- and intervention-free approach to childbirth and more one-on-one time with their health care provider. Ginger Breedlove, former president of the American College of Nurse-Midwives, writes in an email, ""I'm always moved when I've finished an appointment and hear a woman say, 'No one has ever spent this amount of time discussing issues – or cared enough to make sure I understood – or even waited for me to ask more questions.'"" Midwifery is growing. And Breedlove points out that there are many areas of the country that are medically underserved or aren't served at all by maternity care providers such as nurse midwives, obstetricians or gynecologists.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 11.3 percent employment growth for nurse midwives between 2020 and 2030. In that period, an estimated 800 jobs should open up."
